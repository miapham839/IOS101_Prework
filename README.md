## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**1. My Favorite Apps**
* Notion
  - Can combine notes, tasks, databases, and calendar in one place.
  - Can share pages and workspaces with others, assign tasks, and track real-time progess
    -> Great for managing large projects.
* Duolingo
  - Gamified learning: has streaks, leaderboards, levels that make progress feels exciting.
  - Iconic owl mascot -> gives the app a very approachable personality and makes it recognizable
  - Humorous and effective daily reminders.

* Spotify
  - Cross-device syncing -> can continue listening to where you left off when switching devices.
  - Has personalized Weekly and Daily mixes tailored to user's tastes.
 
    
**2. My App Idea: Study Smart**

A student-focused app that helps students track, analyze, and enhance study habits. The **Study Session Tracker** allows users to log study sessions with details like subject, type, and difficulty. A **Weekly Summary** provides visual insights into total hours, subject distribution, and daily trends. (e.g. pie charts, bar graphs)

To encourage progress, the **Productivity Score** evaluates daily performance based on session length, subject variety, and consistency, then generates customized motivational messages based on the score. The **Streaks** system celebrates achievements with badges for milestones like consecutive study days or hours logged, keeping users motivated. 

With **Goal Tracking**, users can set weekly targets and monitor progress through visual trackers. The **Study Session Insights** feature identifies patterns such as peak productivity times and session trends to optimize performance.

Features summary:
- Study Session Tracker
- Weekly Summary
- Productivity Score
- Streaks
- Goal Tracking
- Study Session Insights

## Notes

One challenge I faced was commiting and pushing my project to Github, since I was unfamiliar with it. I managed to get over it after watching the tutorial included in the Prework's instructions.
